# information-loss-in-noisy-channel-vs-theory

ğŸ’» In Julia, Pluto Notebook <br>

ğŸ“Œ Generated a binary message to put through a simulated noisy channel <br>
ğŸ“Œ Added sliders to control Noise Probability and Message Length <br>
ğŸ“Œ Measured empirical bit error rate, mutual information content and entropy with some of Julia's "InformationMeasures" packages <br>
ğŸ“Œ Graphed a comparision between Empirical mutual information and Shannon's theoretical channel capacity <br>
